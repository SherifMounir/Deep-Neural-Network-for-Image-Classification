# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
I'll use some Functions i've implemented in the previous assignment "Logistic Regression Classifier to Recognize Cats" and implement new Helper Functions to build a Deep Network and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification . Hopefully, I'll see an improvement in accuracy relative to the previous logistic regression implementation .
   # 4 - Architecture of the Model
     * Now that we familiar with the dataset , It's time to build a deep neural network to distinguish cat images from non-cat images .           I'll build two different models :
          * A 2-layer neural network
          * An L-layer deep neural network
     * Then compare the performance of these models , and also try out different values for L .
