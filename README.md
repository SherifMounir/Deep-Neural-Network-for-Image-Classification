# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
I'll use some Functions i've implemented in the previous assignment "Logistic Regression Classifier to Recognize Cats" and implement new Helper Functions to build a Deep Network and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification . Hopefully, I'll see an improvement in accuracy relative to the previous logistic regression implementation .
